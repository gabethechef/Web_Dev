									<p>Welcome Recruits! This guide will detail everything you need to know to about the BMT course. Through this curriculum you will be taught the basics of solidering, which includes everything from folding blankets to throwing live grenades.</p>

									<h3 id="MonoIntake">Mono-Intake?</h3>
									<p>The dreaded mono-intake? What is it and what does it mean for me?</p>
									<p>A mono-intake is essentially a unit that you have been pre-assigned to e.g. Armour, Infantry, Guards. Your intake batch will stick together for the entirety of your NS duration (BMT, Unit, Reservist) as you guys will be replacing an outgoing batch.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/mono.png" alt="Picture of recruits during POP parade" /></span>
									<p>Generally what this means for you, if you happen to land in a mono-intake, is a more demanding BMT. Since you will be trained by Sargents from your specific unit and held to the standard of that unit. On top of that, there may be extra unit specific training or physcial standards that you will be expected to attain. </p>
									
									<h3 id="EnlistmentDay">Enlistment Day</h3>
									<p>On your enlistment day, show up in long pants and covered shoes, since you will be taking the oath of allegiance in camp. Show up at the reporting venue, after which you and your guests will take the ferry to Tekong where there will be a tour of the bunk and other facilities. After the tour you will take the oath and depending on your reporting time there may be a meal provided. </p>
									<p>After your parents/guests have left is when the fun begins; i.e your Sargents will start shouting. You will then be directed to collect your equipment all of which neatly packed in a massive black duffel bag. Now with your new equipment, your commanders will go through all the equipment with you, they will show you how to wear the uniform, fiddle with the garters and facilitate any change of sizes. By this time you would already have met and gotten familiar with your buddy, it is in your best interest to get along with him as a good reliable buddy can make or break your BMT experience.     </p>

									<p>The above timetable shows a typical day in BMT, there is usually 2 main activities for the day: one before and after lunch. On top of physical trainings, you will also be spending a lot of time in other ad-hoc admin tasks such as company interviews, recruitment talks and area cleaning. </p>
									<p>As a recruit you can expect about 2 hours of admin time a day, usually after dinner or throughout the day after activities as you will be given time to rest and wash up. </p>



									<hr class="major" id="IFC" />
									<h2> BMT Curriculum</h2>
									<p>The 3 high-key activities in the curriculum are the IFC, IPPT and BTP. In order to complete the BMT course, you must pass 2 of the 3 High-keys, with an attendence of at least 75%. If not, you will likely have to re-course the entire BMT. </p>
									
									<h3 id="IFC">Outfield - Indiviudal Field Craft (IFC) | High-key</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/ifc_pic.jpg" alt="Formation patches for mono-intakes" /></span>
									<p>The infamous outfield. This is without a doubt the most challenging phase of the BMT curriculum. You will spend 5D4N in the Tekong wilderness, at the mercy of the weather.  </p>
									<h4>IFC activity list:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Day 1: Orientation + Fire Movement Practise</li>
											<li>Day 2: Dig Shellscrape + Night Movement</li>
											<li>Day 3: Fire Movement test + Tekan Session + Letter from parents</li>
											<li>Day 4: Movement to SIT test site</li>
											<li>Day 5: Situational Test (SIT)</li>
										</ul>
									<p>The first day of the IFC is mostly orientation, for you to get familar with the area and acclimatize you the Tekong forrest. Day 2 will be a tiring day as you will be digging your shellscrape in addition to your fire movement practise, make peace with your maker and hope for good weather.</p>
									<p>Once you look past the dirt and grime of the forest, the IFC can actually be a fruitful experience. Just keep in the back of your mind that on Day 3 regardless of how well your platoon performs there will always be a tekan session. Don't take it personally its just a convenient time for your sargents to kick you while your down, moreover the tekan session makes the heartfelt letter from your parents all the more meaningful.</p>
									<h4>Pro tips:</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>Zip-lock everything, you can't predict the weather.</li>
											<li>Bring Wet wipes. You will need it for personal hygine, remember to dispose it responsibly.</li>
											<li>Keep your torchlight on you at all times, it gets dark sooner than you expect. Bring extra batteries.</li>
											<li>Black tape. You'll need it for everything you can imagine.</li>
											<li>Powder everywhere, even if it dosen't rain there's always dew in the mornings.</li>
											<li>Always help out your mates. You're all in this together, and can't afford any animosity.</li>
										</ol>
									<p>Minimally to pass IFC you have to complete day 3, afterwards you can fall out without failing this High-key. If you are looking to go to OCS/SCS the SIT test on Day 5 is crucial, it is a key opportunity to showcase your leadership qualities and highlight your abililty to work cohesively as a team.</p>
									
									<h3 id="IPPT">Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) | High-key</h3>
									<p>The IPPT is another one of BMT's high-key. Fear not for you will get 3 attempts spaced throughout your tenure in Tekong and only the highest score will be taken. For those looking to get into SCS/OCS you should aim minimally for at least a Silver to be considered. </p>

									</table>
									<p>I have added an incentive coloumn showing how much you would can claim once a year for attaining IPPT awards. This is only applicable <b>after</b> you are posted out to unit. </p>
									<h4>IPPT components:</h4>
									<ol>
										<li>Push up</li>
										<li>Sit-up</li>
										<li>2.4km Run</li>
									</ol>
									<p>The mordern IPPT only consists of 3 components. It used to include shuttle run, standing board jump and chin ups; So let's all count our blessings that we don't have that. Now if you're aiming for a gold, I would suggest you plan out your IPPT strategy based on the <a href="https://www.ns.sg/nsp/wcm/connect/9e1e31dc-cc14-46f1-83b2-3246fe2f8bbf/New+IPPT+Format+and+Scoring+System+for+Hometeam.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">scoring rubrics</a>. Placing empahsis on your weaker stations and making up points in your strengths. Also take note of the point of diminishing returns: the difference between 40 and 48 push ups is just 1 point. </p>

									<h3 id="BTP">Live Firing - Basic Trainfire Package (BTP) | High-key </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/btp_pic.jpeg" alt="Picture of recruits doing the BTP" /></span>
									<p>On to the last high-key, in order to pass you have to hit at least <b>16 of 32 shots</b>. Its very unlikely that you will fail this components as long as you're present, as even if you don't pass on the first attempt you will keep repeating the firing until you hit the passing threshold. For the ambitious recruits the marksman threshold is 28 out of 32 shots (87.5%). </p>
									<p>Do expect lots of waiting, since you will at the range the entire day waiting on your fellow recruits to complete their turn. In addition, you might come to realise that cleaning the rifle is more tedious than shooting it, BMTC is strict with the upkeeping of their weapons so cleaning it will take the better part of your day.</p>

									<h3 id="SOC">Standard Obstacle Course (SOC)</h3>
									<p>The SOC is a 12 part obstacle course designed to test your strength and agility while you're kitted up. Basically a Ninja warrior course with your SAR21.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/SOC.png" alt="SOC directory" /></span>
									<h4>Standard Obstable Course components:</h4>
										<ol>
											<li>Low wall</li>
											<li>Stepping stones</li>
											<li>Rubble</li>
											<li>Tunnel</li>
											<li>Dodging Panels</li>
											<li>Low Rope</li>
											<li>Ditch</li>
											<li>Corridor</li>
											<li>Balacing Bridge</li>
											<li>Window</li>
											<li>Apex Ladder</li>
											<li>Terrace</li>
										</ol>
									<p>If you can pass your IPPT the entire course should be manageable. The only 2 components that are challenging is the Low Wall and Low Rope, which conincidentally are not remotely low. The trick for the Low wall is to run at it and kick off the wall for elavation; As for the Low rope the secret is all in the feet, learn how to lock the rope between your boots and you will breeze thorugh this.</p>

									<h3 id="24km">24km Route March</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/route_march.jpg" alt="Recruits on their final 24km route march" /></span>
									<p>Finally you've made it to the end of your BMT, to cap it all off you will embark on the 24km route march. The 24km route march is done progressively starting with a 4km march in vest slack, gradually building up to the entire 24km carrying your LBS and Field Pack. The pace is usually 45mins for every 4km (11:25/Km), followed by a 15mins break; Total elapsed time will take about 6 hours</p>
									<p>There's no secret the route march, my only advise would be to keep yourself entertained either by talking to your buddies or singing songs. Before you know it, you'll see the break of dawn and will no longer be a recruit. If all else fails, just sound out to your commanders. This is not a high-key and will not affected your POP.</p>
